# se-cpp-228  
This repository stores C++ tasks done during C++ course in the 1st year of HSE SE  
Every task stores in single folder which name **matches the task name**  
  
The task conditions are located in `README.md` files, solutions - in files whose names **match the task** name and which have `.cpp` extension, if there is one. If there is not, open header file (with `.h` extension)  
Among tasks there is a number of tasks with realization some classes from `std`:
* `std::string`
* `std::stack`
* `std::queue`
* `std::unordered_set`
* `std::unique_ptr`
* `std::shared_ptr + std::weak_ptr`
* `std::string_view`
* `\<csting>`
* `std::list`
* `std::vector`  
Other tasks are usually dedicated to algorithms or correct realization of some methods, classes or iterators
